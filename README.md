# Development Portfolio of Holden Melander

## Description

This webpage has been designed with the goal of sharing my personal and group project with those who may show interest. As my personal development skills improve so will this webpage and its layout. 

## Visuals

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![My potfolio webpage includes a navigation bar, a portfolio picture, a project section with links to projects I have completed, contact information, and a footer.](./assets/images/mockup.png)

The following <a href="https://essence1987.github.io/SoloProject/">Link</a> takes you to the page.

**Note** This mockup may not fully match the current pages functionality. It is a continual work in progress with Projects updated as they become available for general public use. 

## Support
If you have issues with broken links or web accesability issues please send me a message at hwmelander@gmail.com.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
This is considered my personal project. I am not accepting colaboration requests at this time.

## Project status
