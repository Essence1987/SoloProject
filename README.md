# Development Portfolio of Holden Melander

## Description

This webpage has been created to share my personal and group project with those who may show interest. As my development skills improve, so will this webpage and its layout. 

## Visuals

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![My potfolio webpage includes a navigation bar, a portfolio picture, a project section with links to projects I have completed, contact information, and a footer.](./assets/images/mockup.png)

The following <a href="https://essence1987.github.io/SoloProject/">Link</a> takes you to the page.

**Note** This mockup may not fully match the current page's functionality. It is a continual work in progress, with Projects updated as they become available to the public.
